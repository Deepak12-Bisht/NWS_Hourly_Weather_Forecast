# 🌦️ NWS Hourly Weather Forecast & Alert Checker  

### 📘 Project Overview  
This project focuses on retrieving, analyzing, and visualizing **real-time hourly weather forecast data** using the **National Weather Service (NWS) API**.  
It also includes a **Weather Alert Checker** that identifies any active warnings such as storms, floods, or extreme conditions.  

The goal of this project is to showcase an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** — from **data collection → transformation → visualization → SQL-based analysis**.

## 🎯 Project Summary  

- Fetched **live hourly weather forecast data** for a U.S. location using the NWS API.  
- Extracted, cleaned, and structured **JSON data** into a **Pandas DataFrame**.  
- Performed **data visualization** to show hourly temperature variations and weather patterns.  
- Implemented a **Weather Alert Checker** to monitor severe weather alerts in real time.  
- Exported the processed dataset and performed **SQL-based analysis in MySQL** to explore trends and insights.

## 📊 Key Insights  

- Successfully integrated **real-time weather API** data and transformed it into a structured analytical dataset.  
- Identified **warmest and coldest hours**, along with temperature variation patterns.  
- Discovered **most frequent weather conditions** such as Clear, Cloudy, and Rainy.  
- Compared **average temperature between daytime and nighttime** to observe hourly trends.  
- Analyzed **wind direction and speed patterns** to understand atmospheric conditions.  
- Implemented a **real-time alert system** to detect any active warnings for the selected location.

## 💾 SQL Analytics  

The cleaned dataset was imported into **MySQL** for extended analysis, answering queries such as:
- What are the **highest and lowest temperatures** in the forecast?  
- What are the **daily high and low temperatures**?  
- Which **weather conditions occur most frequently**?  
- How does the **average temperature differ between day and night**?  
- What is the **most common wind direction** and the **highest wind speed** recorded?

## 🔮 Future Enhancements  

- Extend to **7-day or 14-day weather forecasts**.  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** using Streamlit or Plotly.  
- Automate **daily data updates** and alert notifications.  
- Add support for **multiple geographic locations**.
